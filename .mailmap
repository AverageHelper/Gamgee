# Use this file to specify a canonical name for `git log` to use for
# your email address, as used in commit authorship. Useful for when your
# name has changed over the repo's history, or you want to use a different
# name than what's listed in the Git log.
#
# NOTE: Some commits contain a "Co-authored by" line in the commit
# message that contains your old name. The only way to fix those, as far
# as I know, is to rewrite the repo's history.
